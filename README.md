# 🛒 eCart – React E-Commerce Frontend UI

**eCart** is a fully responsive and modern e-commerce frontend project built using **React.js**. Developed as part of an internship task, this project is designed to mimic the look and feel of a real-world e-commerce website with features like product listings, detailed product views, and smooth navigation — all crafted using only frontend technologies.

## 📌 Features

🔹 Clean and responsive UI built with React & CSS
🔹 Dynamic routing with React Router
🔹 Detailed product view pages (title, ratings, price, description)
🔹 Category-based product rendering
🔹 Professional styling with hover animations and transitions
🔹 Mobile-friendly layout using media queries
🔹 JSON-based mock data simulating real API

## 🧪 Technologies Used

* ⚛️ React.js (Hooks, Routing, State)
* 🎨 CSS3 (Custom styles, animations, responsive design)
* 📁 JSON (Static data source for products)
* 🔗 React Router DOM
* 🧠 Functional components with modular structure

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
